Description: Wine Wizard is a new GUI for Wine written in Qt
 General feature of Wine Wizard - solutions, that users can create and edit directly from the application. Solution is a instruction what libraries, settings and versions of Wine are required for installation and running MS Windows application. If the solution already created, a user only choose the solution and run the installation file, Wine Wizard makes all work automatically. Unlike PlayOnLinux, a knowledge of the Shell language is not required for creation of solutions, everything is done with the mouse. Solutions are not required confirmation and verification, it makes possible to quickly build database of solutions. In the last resort, a user can write custom script that will be shown to the user before executing (disabled by default).
